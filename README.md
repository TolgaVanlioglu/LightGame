A game with an amazing lighting system

This is a tech demo meant to show a lighting system I created, which supports basic objects such as rectangles, other polygons and circles, all with rotation. This could/will be used for a cool snake/pacman like game one day :)

(flashlighttest.yyp is used to open the project in Gamemaker Studio 2, and LightGame.zip has the compiled .exe)
